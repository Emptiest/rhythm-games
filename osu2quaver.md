# So you're an osu!mania player
And you're here because maybe you've heard of yet another VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game) called [*Quaver*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/980610/Quaver/). Maybe I directed you here from my stream because this question gets asked a lot. Don't worry! This readme is here to try and help.

If you're coming from Etterna, I can't help you from personal experience, as I haven't played Etterna much. I have heard positive things from my friends who have played Etterna, however, and I encourage you to check Quaver out!

## Disclaimers

I'm just a guy that plays video games. Sometimes rhythm games. I stream occasionally on Twitch, and am a Twitch Affiliate (meaning people can subscribe to my channel) but I have no sponsors or anything like that. Quaver didn't pay me to write this. I just saw the value in having stuff listed out

# What's different?
### Optimization
For most people I know, Quaver runs much more smoothly than osu!mania does on their hardware. Before playing Quaver, I thought osu was smooth, but because of how much smoother Quaver ran osu now seems like a stutter-fest. Your mileage may vary, of course, and you'll likely notice a bigger difference if you have the capability of running the game at a higher refresh rate than 60Hz.

### Features
There are lots of features I won't bother including on this list, but here are the ones I feel actually matter, not in any particular order:

<details>
  <summary> Click for the list! âœ… </summary>

* Live Map Previews

    ![Live Map Previews](/images/LNPercent.png)


* A much better editor
* You can download maps in-game without needing to donate
* You can adjust the rate at which a song plays in 0.05x increments, from 0.50x to 2.00x, and those plays are rankable if on ranked songs
* Customizable judgment windows
* Hate LNs? There is an (unranked) NO LN mod you can apply to any map!
* Love LNs? There is an (unranked) FULL LN mod you can apply to any map!
* *Really* Love LNs? There is an (unranked) INVERSE mod you can apply to any map!
* By the way, the hit and release of LNs are treated as separate notes for scoring
* You can know before playing a map what % of the notes on the map are LNs
* Highly acc-centric scoring system
* Much better (read: actually functional) tools for fixing offset
* Supports importing maps from osu!mania, Etterna, and other games
* Reverse SV, if you're into that
* 4K and 7K ranking is separated
* A more useful results screen
* Leaderboards on unranked songs^
* Multiplayer map uploads (You can share unsubmitted maps with players in your lobby)^
* And probably more useful features to come...!

(^) = Donator Features

### Community
4K and 7K are the only gamemodes in Quaver. Unlike in osu, where osu!standard often overshadows players in the osu!mania community whenever it comes to larger community discussions, Quaver has no other game modes.

The developers also actually play the game. And they're involved in the community. If there's something bad or broken about the game, they generally have an inherent interest in fixing it.

### Leaderboards
As mentioned earlier, 4K and 7K are the only gamemodes. Their ranking is also separated. The points you receive toward ranking are based on your accuracy, rather than on the score of the play.

# Why should you stay on osu?
While I'm a fan of Quaver, it's not perfect. It's still very clearly a beta. Here are a couple reasons why you might want to stick with osu!mania over Quaver.

* You like storyboards and videos
  * Quaver does not support any sort of animated backgrounds during play. If you import an osu!mania map into Quaver that has videos or storyboard elements, none of those will get transferred over.
* You are engaged with the larger osu community and you would like to stay
* Lots of the maps in your library have foreign characters in the metadata
  * Kind of a weird technical restriction Quaver has: it cannot import maps that have foreign characters in them.
* Stability
  * Quaver is, of course, still in beta. Lots of things are subject to change. If you don't like change, maybe Quaver isn't for you (yet).
* Converting your skin(s) is a pain
  * Anecdotally, I spent about 3 hours converting my osu!mania skin over to Quaver, and mine is a pretty simple bar skin. There is a [skin converter](https://rhythmgamers.net/QBC/) but it's nowhere near perfect yet.
