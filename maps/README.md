# Maps
This folder contains two subfolders; one for osu! mania and one for Quaver. The file formats are very different so please make sure you download the appropriate files for your game.

Contains the mapping files for any rhythm game maps I create. To download the actual maps for your own play, go to the respective map page for the game to download. MP3's and stuff are *not* hosted here.
