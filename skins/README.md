# Skins
This folder contains two subfolders; one for osu! mania and one for Quaver. The file formats are very different so please make sure you download the appropriate files for your game.

The files in this folder are presented for your own skin creations (e.g. as an example of folder structure, or if you want to take specific elements of the skins and adapt them for your own use)

If you want to download a skin to use for yourself, please go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Emptiest/rhythm-games/releases) page.

Each skin in this repository started off as something I just lifted from someplace on the internet, but I've modified them enough that they are very different from the originals. The original authors are still credited in their respective 'Creator' fields in the skin metadata.
